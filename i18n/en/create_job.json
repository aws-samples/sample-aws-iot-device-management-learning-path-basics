    "resource_discovery_description": "Before creating an IoT Job, we need to discover available thing groups and packages.\nThing groups define which devices will receive the job. For OTA jobs, we also need\npackages from the Software Package Catalog. Other job types can work with thing\ngroups alone, making them more flexible for various device operations.\n\n🔄 NEXT: We will scan for available thing groups and IoT packages in your account",
    "job_type_title": "Job Type Selection - Choosing Operation Type",
    "job_type_description": "AWS IoT Jobs support two main operation types:\n• OTA Updates: Firmware deployment with AWS IoT Software Package Catalog integration\n• Custom Operations: Any device-specific commands or workflows with custom job documents\n\n🔄 NEXT: We will select the job type and configure the operation",
    "target_config_title": "Target and Configuration Setup",
    "target_config_description": "Now we'll configure job targets, execution parameters, and advanced settings.\nAdvanced configurations include rollout rates, retry policies, abort criteria,\nand timeout settings. These ensure reliable job execution across large fleets\nwith proper error handling and performance optimization.\n\n🔄 NEXT: We will configure the {} job parameters",
    "job_creation_title": "Job Creation - Deploying to Fleet",
    "job_creation_description": "We'll now create the {} job with all configured settings.\nThe job will be deployed to the selected thing groups with the specified\nrollout, retry, and abort configurations. Devices will receive the job\ndocument and execute the defined operations according to the job parameters.\n\n🔄 NEXT: We will create and deploy the job to {} thing groups",
    "rollout_config_title": "Rollout Configuration - Controlled Deployment Strategy",
    "rollout_config_description": "Rollout configuration controls how quickly jobs are deployed across your fleet:\n• Simple Rate Limiting: Set maximum executions per minute (e.g., 50 devices/min)\n• Exponential Rollout: Start slow, increase rate based on success criteria\n\nExponential rollout is safer for large fleets - it starts with a small number of devices,\nmonitors success rates, and gradually increases deployment speed. This prevents\nwidespread failures from bad firmware or configuration changes.",
    "execution_rate_title": "Job Execution Rate - Performance Optimization",
    "execution_rate_description": "Execution rate settings control how fast individual devices process jobs:\n• Max Executions Per Minute: Prevents overwhelming your IoT infrastructure\n• Exponential Rate: Gradually increases processing speed based on success\n\nThese settings are different from rollout config - rollout controls how many devices\nget the job, while execution rate controls how fast each device processes it.\nProper rate limiting prevents API throttling and ensures stable job execution.",
    "abort_config_title": "Abort Configuration - Automatic Failure Protection",
    "abort_config_description": "Abort criteria automatically cancel jobs when failure rates exceed thresholds:\n• Failure Threshold: Percentage of devices that must fail before abort (e.g., 10%)\n• Minimum Executions: Number of devices to test before applying threshold\n• Failure Types: FAILED, REJECTED, TIMED_OUT, or ALL\n\nThis prevents bad firmware or configurations from spreading across your entire fleet.\nFor example: 'Cancel job if >10% of devices fail after testing on at least 5 devices'\nEssential for production deployments to minimize blast radius of failures.",
    "timeout_config_title": "Timeout Configuration - Preventing Stuck Jobs",
    "timeout_config_description": "Timeout settings prevent job executions from running indefinitely:\n• In-Progress Timeout: Maximum time a device can spend processing a job\n• Prevents devices from getting stuck in IN_PROGRESS state\n• Automatically marks stuck executions as TIMED_OUT\n\nTypical values: 60 minutes for firmware updates, 10 minutes for configuration changes.\nWithout timeouts, stuck devices can prevent job completion and waste resources.\nEssential for maintaining fleet health and job lifecycle management.",
    "target_selection_title": "Target Selection - Device Inclusion Strategy",
    "target_selection_description": "Target selection determines how jobs handle devices added to thing groups after job creation:\n• CONTINUOUS: Automatically includes new devices added to target groups (recommended)\n• SNAPSHOT: Only targets devices that existed in groups at job creation time\n\nCONTINUOUS jobs are ideal for dynamic fleets where devices are frequently added,\nwhile SNAPSHOT jobs provide predictable, fixed target lists for controlled deployments."
