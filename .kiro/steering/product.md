# Product Overview

This is an AWS IoT Device Management learning project that demonstrates comprehensive IoT device lifecycle management capabilities. The project provides hands-on experience with:

- **Device Provisioning**: Creating and managing IoT devices with proper thing types and attributes
- **Fleet Organization**: Managing devices through static and dynamic thing groups
- **OTA Updates**: Implementing firmware updates using AWS IoT Jobs with S3 integration
- **Package Management**: Handling multiple firmware versions with automated shadow updates
- **Job Execution**: Simulating realistic device behavior during firmware updates

## Target Audience
IoT developers, solution architects, and DevOps engineers working with AWS IoT device fleets at associate level.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Device lifecycle management at scale
- Fleet organization and management
- Over-the-air update implementation
- Version control and rollback capabilities
- Proper resource cleanup to manage costs

## Cost Considerations
This project creates real AWS resources that incur charges ($0.27 - $2.40 per complete demo session). Always run cleanup scripts when finished to avoid ongoing costs.
