# Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions for common issues encountered when using the AWS IoT Device Management scripts.

## Common Issues

### AWS Configuration Issues

#### Problem: "Unable to locate credentials"
```
NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
# Enter: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region, Output format

# Verify configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

#### Problem: "Access Denied" errors
```
AccessDeniedException: User is not authorized to perform: iot:CreateThing
```

**Solution**: Ensure your AWS IAM user/role has the required permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:*",
                "iot-data:*",
                "iot-jobs-data:*",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:CreateBucket",
                "s3:DeleteBucket",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Problem: "Region not configured"
```
You must specify a region
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Set region in AWS CLI
aws configure set region us-east-1

# Or use environment variable
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Script Execution Issues

#### Problem: "No module named 'colorama'"
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colorama'
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install individually
pip install colorama>=0.4.4 requests>=2.25.1
```

#### Problem: Scripts hang or timeout
**Symptoms**: Scripts appear to freeze during execution

**Solution**:
1. Enable debug mode to see what's happening:
   ```bash
   # When prompted, choose 'y' for debug mode
   üîß Enable debug mode? [y/N]: y
   ```

2. Check AWS service limits and throttling
3. Reduce parallel workers if needed
4. Check network connectivity

#### Problem: "Thing type deletion requires 5-minute wait"
```
InvalidRequestException: Thing type cannot be deleted until 5 minutes after deprecation
```

**Solution**: This is expected behavior. The cleanup script handles this automatically by:
1. Deprecating thing types first
2. Waiting 5 minutes
3. Then deleting them

### Resource Creation Issues

#### Problem: "Thing group already exists"
```
ResourceAlreadyExistsException: Thing group already exists
```

**Solution**: This is usually harmless. Scripts check for existing resources and skip creation if they already exist.

#### Problem: "S3 bucket name already taken"
```
BucketAlreadyExists: The requested bucket name is not available
```

**Solution**: Scripts use timestamps to ensure unique bucket names. If this occurs:
1. Wait a few seconds and retry
2. Check if you have existing buckets with similar names

#### Problem: "Package version already exists"
```
ConflictException: Package version already exists
```

**Solution**: Scripts handle this by checking existing versions first. If you need to update:
1. Use a new version number
2. Or delete the existing version first

### Job Execution Issues

#### Problem: "No active jobs found"
```
‚ùå No active jobs found
```

**Solution**:
1. Create a job first using `scripts/create_job.py`
2. Verify job status: `scripts/explore_jobs.py`
3. Check if jobs were cancelled or completed

#### Problem: "Failed to download artifact"
```
‚ùå Failed to download artifact: HTTP 403 Forbidden
```

**Solution**:
1. Check AWS IAM role permissions for AWS IoT Jobs
2. Verify presigned URL configuration
3. Ensure S3 bucket and objects exist
4. Check if presigned URLs have expired (1-hour limit)

#### Problem: "Job execution not found"
```
ResourceNotFoundException: Job execution not found
```

**Solution**:
1. Verify job ID and thing name are correct
2. Check if the device is in the target thing groups
3. Ensure the job is still active (not completed/cancelled)

### Fleet Indexing Issues

#### Problem: "Fleet Indexing queries return no results"
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è No devices currently match this query
```

**Solution**:
1. Wait for Fleet Indexing to complete (can take several minutes)
2. Verify Fleet Indexing is enabled
3. Check query syntax
4. Ensure devices have the expected attributes/shadows

#### Problem: "Invalid Fleet Indexing query"
```
InvalidRequestException: Invalid query string
```

**Solution**: Check query syntax. Common issues:
- Use `attributes.fieldName` for device attributes
- Use `shadow.reported.fieldName` for classic shadows
- Use `shadow.name.\\$package.reported.fieldName` for named shadows
- Escape special characters properly

### Performance Issues

#### Problem: "Rate limiting errors"
```
ThrottlingException: Rate exceeded
```

**Solution**: Scripts have built-in rate limiting, but if you encounter this:
1. Enable debug mode to see which API is being throttled
2. Reduce parallel workers in the script
3. Add delays between operations
4. Check AWS service limits for your account

#### Problem: "Scripts running slowly"
**Symptoms**: Operations take much longer than expected

**Solution**:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify AWS region is geographically close
3. Enable debug mode to identify bottlenecks
4. Consider reducing batch sizes

### Data Consistency Issues

#### Problem: "Device shadows not updating"
```
‚ùå Failed to update device shadow
```

**Solution**:
1. Check IoT Data endpoint configuration
2. Verify device/thing exists
3. Ensure proper JSON formatting in shadow updates
4. Check AWS IAM permissions for shadow operations

#### Problem: "Package configuration not working"
```
‚ùå Failed to update global package configuration
```

**Solution**:
1. Verify IoTPackageConfigRole exists and has proper permissions
2. Check if role ARN is correctly formatted
3. Ensure package configuration is enabled in your region

## Debug Mode Usage

Enable debug mode in any script for detailed troubleshooting:

```bash
üîß Enable debug mode (show all commands and outputs)? [y/N]: y
```

Debug mode shows:
- All AWS CLI commands being executed
- API request parameters
- Full API responses
- Error details and stack traces

## Log Analysis

### Successful Operations
Look for these indicators:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks for successful operations
- Progress counters showing completion
- "completed successfully" messages

### Warning Signs
Watch for these patterns:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warnings (usually non-critical)
- "already exists" messages (usually harmless)
- Timeout warnings

### Error Patterns
Common error indicators:
- ‚ùå Red X marks for failures
- "Failed to" messages
- Exception stack traces
- HTTP error codes (403, 404, 500)

## Recovery Procedures

### Partial Provisioning Failure
If provisioning fails partway through:

1. **Check what was created**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/explore_jobs.py
   # Option 1: List all jobs
   ```

2. **Clean up if needed**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/cleanup_script.py
   # Option 1: ALL resources
   ```

3. **Retry provisioning**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/provision_script.py
   # Scripts handle existing resources gracefully
   ```

### Failed Job Recovery
If a job fails during execution:

1. **Check job status**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/explore_jobs.py
   # Option 2: Explore specific job
   ```

2. **Check individual failures**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/explore_jobs.py
   # Option 3: Explore job execution
   ```

3. **Rollback if needed**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/manage_packages.py
   # Select: 10. Revert Device Versions
   # Enter thing type and previous version
   ```

### Resource Cleanup Issues
If cleanup fails:

1. **Try selective cleanup**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/cleanup_script.py
   # Option 2: Things only (then try groups)
   ```

2. **Manual cleanup via AWS Console**:
   - AWS IoT Core ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Things
   - AWS IoT Core ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Thing groups
   - AWS IoT Core ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Thing types
   - Amazon S3 ‚Üí Buckets
   - AWS IAM ‚Üí Roles

## Environment-Specific Issues

### macOS Issues
- **SSL warnings**: Scripts suppress urllib3 SSL warnings automatically
- **Python version**: Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed

### Windows Issues
- **Path separators**: Scripts handle cross-platform paths automatically
- **PowerShell**: Use Command Prompt or PowerShell with proper execution policy

### Linux Issues
- **Permissions**: Ensure scripts have execute permissions
- **Python path**: May need to use `python3` instead of `python`

## AWS Service Limits

### Default Limits (per region)
- **Things**: 500,000 per account
- **Thing Types**: 100 per account
- **Thing Groups**: 500 per account
- **Jobs**: 100 concurrent jobs
- **API Rate Limits**: 
  - Thing operations: 100 TPS (scripts use 80 TPS)
  - Dynamic groups: 5 TPS (scripts use 4 TPS)
  - Job executions: 200 TPS (scripts use 150 TPS)
  - Package operations: 10 TPS (scripts use 8 TPS)

### Request Limit Increases
If you need higher limits:
1. Go to AWS Support Center
2. Create a case for "Service limit increase"
3. Specify AWS IoT Core limits needed

## Getting Help

### Enable Verbose Logging
Most scripts support verbose mode:
```bash
üîß Enable verbose mode? [y/N]: y
```

## Prevention Tips

### Before Running Scripts
1. **Verify AWS configuration**: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
2. **Check permissions**: Test with a small operation first
3. **Review resource limits**: Ensure you won't hit account limits
4. **Backup important data**: If modifying existing resources

### During Execution
1. **Monitor progress**: Watch for error patterns
2. **Don't interrupt**: Let scripts complete or use Ctrl+C gracefully
3. **Check AWS Console**: Verify resources are being created as expected

### After Execution
1. **Verify results**: Use explore scripts to check outcomes
2. **Clean up test resources**: Use cleanup script for temporary resources
3. **Monitor costs**: Check AWS billing for unexpected charges
